Welcome to our Malmo Runner Project

Steve needs to get to the end of a deadly maze. On his way over there are many magma and stone tiles and a scatter of healthy and poisonous food. Using Reinforcement learning Steve will train how to get to the end of the maze by consuming the right kind of food and taking the smallest steps.
